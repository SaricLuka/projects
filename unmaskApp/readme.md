This is a project in Java I did for in my 3rd semester. The project consists of everything we learnt, becuase of which there are some questionable functionalities.


The project is a small madeup app for tracking video game trounaments, that uses JavaFX, Java H2 DB and Maven.

In the program there is 3 groups of users: Guest, User, Admin. Each group has different permissions, the login of users uses HASHes and sessions.
The whole program has an UI, and is multithreaded. There is many features of which most need the users and admins to add/delte/alter..., for example, teams, players...

The project isn't a perfect program, but its mostly to show the features of Java I mastered.
